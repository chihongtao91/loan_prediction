# Loan prediction
Predicting the risk and returns of financial loans

## Objective
For financial institutions (e.g. banks, online lenders), a key task is to evaluate the risk and return of the loans given out. In this project, we will use loans dataset on Kaggle from Lending Club (https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data) to answer below questiosn

1). Will the borrower default on their payment ?  
2) How long will the borrower pay back the loan ?  
3) What type of loan yield the highest return of investment ? 

To run the notebook, make sure you have the datasets (_loan.csv_) downloaded from the kaggle link stored in __./data__ directory, and you have jupyter notebook installed. Then launch the jupyter server and click into the ipython notebook.
